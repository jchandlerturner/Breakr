<b>Project Overview</b>

Communication is an integral part of our lives. We interact daily with strangers, acquaintances, friends, and others that we love. For some people, it’s hard enough to make initial contact. The question then becomes “Well, what do I say?” Thanks to this app, starting a conversation will no longer be an issue. 

The app begins by asking you an initial question such as “What is your relationship with this person?”. You can choose from the four groups of “stranger, acquaintance, lover, and friend”. The app then ask you “what kind of conversation do you want to have?” You can choose from “casual, flirtatious, friendly, philosophical, supportive, and aggressive/confrontational”. The point of this app is to give people everything they need to start the conversation right by knowing who they are talking to and what type of conversation they hope to have. 

<b>Challenge Statement</b>

How can we help users start meaningful conversations? 

<b>Research</b>

I used a mixture of in person qualitative interviews and quantitative data from a survey I sent out to jumpstart my research process. The data I gathered proved invaluable to my app: I was able to narrow the scope of the application, create a user persona, and decide what options would be available within the app.

<b>Wireframes and Mockups</b>

Initially, I researched color palettes on Pinterest and researched other wine-centric websites and apps to get color inspiration. 

I landed on my color palette because I felt like it showcased the different colors of wine I was trying to show on my app. 

I used Figma and hand drawn sketches to prototype the Website:
